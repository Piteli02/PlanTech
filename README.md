# PlanTech
PlanTech is app made in SwiftUI for a challenge on Apple Developer Academy that has the goal to integrate iPhone and Arduino via the Bluetooth module “HC-09”. With that, receive data from sensors responsible for measuring humidity and NPK levels of the soil helping people take care of their plants. Due to technical issues, it was only possible to receive humidity data on the deadline proposed. 

NPK - nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, main nutrients for plant fertilization.
